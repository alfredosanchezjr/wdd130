        Hi everyone! My name is Alfredo Sanchez, but most people just call me Fredo. I’m originally from Georgia, but I’ve been living in Rexburg with my family for the past ten years. I’m majoring in Web Design and Development with a minor in Graphic Design, and I really enjoy creating digital stuff, whether it’s in Figma, Adobe CC, or even just sketching on Procreate.</p>


<p>
        In my free time, I love reading, watching movies, editing videos, and going on random adventures to new places. I also enjoy photography and capturing little moments with friends and family. I’m looking forward to getting to know all of you better this semester and working together in this class!
